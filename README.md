# Powertrain-for-solar-Powered-EV-with-solar-switching-circuitry-and-Maximum-power-point-tracking

This project aims to integrate PV arrays with conventional electric vehicles and minimize the losses by hot swapping between solar supply and battery supply instead of conventional solar energy storage in lead acid batteries.


Designed a Motor controller with Regenerative Braking for BLDC motor control and a solar switching circuitry to hot swap the power supply between Photo-Voltaic arrays and the battery pack, targeting the e-rickshaws.

Implemented maximum power point tracking and currently working on buck boost conversion of the incoming solar supply to provide a nominal voltage to run the motor.
